## **online/offline budget app**<br>
<br>

## description

***
As an avid traveller I want to be able to track my withdrawals and deposits with or without a data/internet connection, so that my account balance is accurate when I am traveling.<br>
Online/Offline Budget App answers these needs and presents an easy to use UI to keep track of transactions, anytime, anywhere. This app utilizes Node.js, Express.js and IndexedDB for offline functionality. It was developed over front end starter code (Budget Tracker) and deployed to Heroku through MongoDB Atlas.
